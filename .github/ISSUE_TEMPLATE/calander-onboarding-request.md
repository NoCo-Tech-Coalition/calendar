There are two existing ways to onboard an organization to this calendar. 

1. Update `data/events.json` to include your event. This works well for reocurring and one-off events where the organizer does not have or want a google calendar.
2. Add information from a public google calendar to `data/calendar-sources.json`. Updates made to the calendar will automatically sync to the NoCo Tech Collective calendar.
